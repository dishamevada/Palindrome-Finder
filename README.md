# Palindrome-Finder
This project finds all possible and valid palindromes for a series of words using the Carnegie Mellon Pronunciation (cmudict) Dictionary. In order to run this program, run the main file Palindrome.java. I created this program using stacks and queues that I implemented from scratch, MyQueue.java and MyStack.java.
